# Pacman hooks kit
> It's just Archlinux pacman hooks installer. Place your hooks to the `hooks` directory and run `./install.sh`.

## Hooks
- `package-list-export.hook` — backups installed packages list to defined path in the user directory.

## Current status (Beta)
Now this repository includes only one hook for my personal purpose. If you have an idea what to place in — feel free to open an issue or pull request :).
`install.sh` script code does not optimal. Doesn't tested with multiple hooks and need to be more generalized.
